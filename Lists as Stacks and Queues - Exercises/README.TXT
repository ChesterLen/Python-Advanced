    1. Reverse Numbers
Write a program that reads a string with N integers from the console, separated by a single space, and reverses them using a stack.
Print the reversed integers on one line, separated by a single space.

    Examples:

    Input: 1 2 3 4 5     Output: 5 4 3 2 1

    Input: 1             Output: 1
