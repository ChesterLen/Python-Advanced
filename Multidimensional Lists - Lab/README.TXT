    1. Sum Matrix Elements
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints:
    • The sum of all numbers in the matrix
    • The matrix itself
On the first line, you will receive the matrix sizes in the format "{rows}, {columns}". On the next rows, you will get elements for each column separated by a comma and a space ", ".

    Examples: 

    Input: 3, 6                 Output: 76
           7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1             [[7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1], [1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6], [4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0]]
           1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6
           4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0
