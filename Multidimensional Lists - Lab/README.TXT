    1. Sum Matrix Elements
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints:
    • The sum of all numbers in the matrix
    • The matrix itself
On the first line, you will receive the matrix sizes in the format "{rows}, {columns}". On the next rows, you will get elements for each column separated by a comma and a space ", ".

    Examples: 

    Input: 3, 6                 Output: 76
           7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1             [[7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1], [1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6], [4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0]]
           1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6
           4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0

    2. Even Matrix
Write a program that receives a matrix of numbers and prints a new one only with the numbers that are even. Use nested comprehension for that problem. 
On the first line, you will receive the rows of the matrix. On the next rows, you will get elements for each column separated with a comma and a space ", ".

    Examples:

    Input: 2                       Output: [[2], [4, 6]]
           1, 2, 3
           4, 5, 6

    Input: 4                       Output: [[10, 24], [34, 110], [4, 12], []]
           4
           10, 33, 24, 5, 1
           67, 34, 11, 110, 3
           4, 12, 33, 63, 21
           557, 45, 23, 55, 67
