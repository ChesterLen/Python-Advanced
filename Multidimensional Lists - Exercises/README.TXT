    1. Diagonals
Using a nested list comprehension, write a program that reads rows of a square matrix and its elements, separated by a comma and a space ", ". You should find the matrix's diagonals, prints them and their sum in the format:
"Primary diagonal: {element1}, {element2}, … {elementN}. Sum: {sum_of_primary}
Secondary diagonal: {element1}, {element2}, … {elementN}. Sum: {sum_of_secondary}".

    Example:
    
    Input: 3        Output: Primary diagonal: 1, 5, 9. Sum: 15
           1, 2, 3          Secondary diagonal: 3, 5, 7. Sum: 15
           4, 5, 6
           7, 8, 9
