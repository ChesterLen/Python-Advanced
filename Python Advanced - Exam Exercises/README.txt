    01. Climb the Peaks
Alex is a vlogger and he wants to make videos of climbing the five highest peaks in Pirin mountain in just one week.  He will take his video set, a tent, and his backpack to the mountain. The backpack fits food portions for one week, exactly. His daily stamina is also limited. 
Your task is to trace his adventure and create a post for his profile @alaroundtheworld, at the end of the journey.
You will have to keep information for all the conquered peaks if any.
Every day, Alex will use one portion of his daily food supplies and will exhaust one of his daily stamina.
First, you will be given a sequence of numbers, representing the quantities of the daily portions of food supplies in his backpack.
Afterward, you will be given another sequence of numbers, representing the quantities of the daily stamina he will have at his disposal for the next seven days.
You have to sum the quantity of the last daily food portion with the quantity of the first daily stamina. He will start climbing from the first peak in the table below to the last one.
    • If the sum is equal to or greater than the corresponding Mountain Peak’s Difficulty level from the table below, it means that the peak is conquered. 
In this case, you should remove both quantities from the sequences and continue with the next ones towards the next peak.
    • If the sum is less than the corresponding Mountain Peak’s Difficulty level from the table below, the peak remains unconquered. You should remove both quantities from the sequences. 
Alex will have to sleep in his tent. On the next day, he will try the same peak once again.
