    1. Unique Usernames
Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N usernames and keeps a collection only of the unique ones. 
On the first line, you will receive an integer N. On the next N lines, you will receive a username. Print the collection on the console (the order does not matter):

    Examples:

    Input: 6            Output: George
           George               Peter
           George               NiceGuy1234
           George
           Peter
           George
           NiceGuy1234

    Input: 10            Output: Peter
           Peter                 Maria
